  instance variables:
   - duration (double)

  constructor:
   - initialize name, company, and duration

   constructor:
    - initialize name, company and location, performer, date

create an object of KevinHart to use the constructors, read the value of each variable to
check if everything is working as expected

List the is a relation of all the classes


Can you answer these:

 What is the purpose of this keyword?

 What is the purpose of super keyword?

 Why do we use constructor chaining?
